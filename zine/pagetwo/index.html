     Google Docs utilizes the cloud in order to allow users access to their documents almost anywhere as long as they are connected to the internet. The entire Google Suite lives purely online. It is a popular system because all content created and stored through the Google suite is cloud based allowing accessibility anywhere. However, the usage of the cloud proves to have drastic effects.

      Cloud Computing allows internet users the ability to access data anywhere at anytime as long as they have access to the internet. Documents, Photos, Video, Media can be stored on a cloud system. Popular cloud systems include Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Google etc. These allow users to access this content digitally, without needing a physical hardrive whether its for commercial or personal use. As Cloud occupies a space often invisible to most, we forget that it actually requires  a physical space as well, requiring the construction of large data centers. These physical spaces require upkeep whether it's intense cooling systems or energy to power them 24/7. How do we uphold our mission for sustainability when we don't hold ourselves accountability for our digital footprint?
